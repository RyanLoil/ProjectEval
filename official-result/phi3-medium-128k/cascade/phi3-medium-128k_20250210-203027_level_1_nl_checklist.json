following aspects:\n\n1. **Frontend** for Employee Submission of Claims:\n   - Create an intuitive user interface where employees can easily submit their expense claims categorized under Travel, Labor, Management, or Equipment expenses. To ensure the design is clear and user-friendly, consider implementing forms with relevant fields based on each category type (e.g., location for travel expenses, dates worked for labor).\n   - Each claim submission should be able to set its status as \"Pending\". It allows users to quickly submit a request without prior approvals, making it easier to track incoming requests.\n   \n2. **Administrator's Approval or Rejection of Claims**: \n - Construct the admin panel using Django which displays all submitted claims in an organized manner and their current statuses (\"Pending\", \"Approved\" & \"Rejected\"). \n   * Employees should be able to view which department received their claim, facilitating better communication. Displaying the assigned agent for each request can also improve transparency between users and administrators.\n - Administrators can change the status of any submitted claims from \u201cPending\u201d to either \"Approved\" or \"Rejected\". It\u2019s essential that admins have a clear review process in place, including validation rules for every category (e.g., appropriate receipts required for travel expenses) to ensure compliance with the company's policy when processing claims.\n   - Consider implementing notification functionalities to alert employees of updates on their submitted claims (such as email notifications). This enhances user experience and ensures efficient communication between users, administrators, and agents.\n\n3. **Budget Control Application**: \n - Develop a system that lets the administrator monitor budget allocation for each expense category in real-time ('Travel', 'Labor', 'Management', & 'Equipment'). This feature helps ensure optimal resource management of accounting subjects and avoids overspending.\n   * A dashboard should be integrated on the admin panel to analyze balances, outstanding reimbursements, or pending claims for each category (Travel, Labor, Management, Equipment). Displaying trends over time can provide valuable insights into expense management practices and help detect any anomalous activities.\n   * Implement alert mechanisms that notify administrators when a specific budget is depleted to ensure funds are appropriately managed across different account categories.\n\n4. **Template Requirements**: \n- The templates should have a responsive design adaptable on mobile and desktops, featuring clean typography with font sizes of between 14px (minimum) - 20px (maximum) for improved readability during all working hours (e.g., day or night shifts). Using complementary color schemes can make content more aesthetically pleasing and accessible to employees with visual impairments.\n- The data entry fields should have validation rules: the minimum & maximum field values, regular expression constraints for specific input formats (numbers only, dates formatted as MM/DD/YYYY etc.) \n\nPlease note that this is an initial design proposal without getting into the nitty-gritty of implementation details. Implementation strategy and coding style will depend heavily on the development team's experience with Django and the project requirements.", "13": {"pages": [{"page": "Customer Profile", "function": [{"function": "Create Customer Profile", "description": "Admin can create a new customer profile by filling in the fields: name, birthday, age, sex, company and phone number."}, {"function": "Update Customer Profile", "description": "Existing customers' profiles can be updated with information such as contact details or any other necessary attributes."}, {"function": "Delete Customer Profile", "description": "The administrator is able to delete customer records, subject to fulfilling proper protocols in place for data management and privacy policies."}]}, {"page": "Product Information", "function": [{"function": "Create New Product", "description": "Add a new product into the system by selecting its name, category and recommended price."}, {"function": "Edit Existing Product", "description": "Product details such as price or description can be updated in order to remain accurate and up-to-date."}]}, {"page": "Purchase Records", "function": [{"function": "Record Purchase History", "description": "Document every purchase a customer makes detailing: the date and time of the sale, product bought, customer who made the purchase, quantity purchased and total cost."}, {"function": "Aggregate Product Sales Data", "description": "Generate summaries or reports that show key statistics such as most sold products or high-value customers for further analysis."}]}, {"page": "Marketing Application", "function": [{"function": "Sales Analysis", "description": "The system should provide comprehensive sales reports outlining customer behavior trends, popular products and periods of high sales activity."}, {"function": "Customer Segmentation for Targeted Marketing", "description": "This feature groups customers based on their purchase behaviors in order to identify potential target audiences.

Read the dataset \"Deathlist.csv\"\n   - Ensure that CSV file exists in the specified location and is accessible.\n   - Check if the file content is readable, and it contains valid data. \n\n2. Extract dates from 'Date of death' field\n   - Parse each row under the \u2018Date of Death\u2019 column and convert the date string format to a usable date-time object in your programming language of choice for easy manipulation (for example: mm/dd/yyyy).\n\n3. Group the data by week\n    - Organize the extracted dates into weeks based on the given week criteria (e.g., Monday to Sunday or Sunday to Saturday). \n   - Create an object to hold these grouped results where each key holds a Week number and its associated value is the count of deaths in that particular week.\n\n4. Count Deaths per week\n    - Sum up the total deaths for every group (week) using your language's built-in function like groupBy or reduce operation if available, otherwise implement this manually.\n   - Populate a new object where each key holds a Week number and its associated value is the count of deaths in that week.\n\n5. Print Hitstogram representation.\n    - Iterate over each item (week) from the grouped object and print or present it as required, usually with bar charts or similar visualizations to represent death counts per week easily. \n   - Consider providing labels for clarity: weeks must be on x-axis and count of deaths should appear along y axis when you're creating graphical representations using tools like matplotlib in Python (if appropriate) or native graphing libraries provided by your programming language. This will help to see patterns if present, as visual representation usually aids understanding more than reading raw numbers\n   \nThis function checklist gives high-level steps on how to approach this problem; the exact implementation would depend heavily on the specifics of given environment and tools at hand such as the database for storing data or the libraries available for date manipulations. The 'XXX' in your template is replaced by these detailed processes, giving a clear direction towards building that functionality.\n   \nNote: Always check how dates are being read from the CSV, this might vary based on programming language and locale/internationalization can potentially cause some inconsistencies if not considered correctly. Also ensure that error handling mechanisms are in place for edge cases like missing or irregular data under 'Date of Death'.", "20": "```json\n{\n    \"page\": \"homepage\",\n    \"function\": [\n        {\n            \"function\": \"header\",\n            \"description\": \"Displays the header section of the blog, including the site'cu logo, search bar and navigation menu.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"function\": \"featured-posts\",\n            \"description\":\"Shows a list of featured posts with title, excerpt or thumbnail image, and link to full post.
