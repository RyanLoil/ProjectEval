This function takes two sorted arrays and returns their cartesian product as a new list. The code should use no loops or built-in sorting functions.\n\nThe `cartesianProduct` function generates all possible combinations from two lists. If your implementation is done by using nested iteration, it may work efficiently for small inputs but becomes very slow on large arrays with over 50 elements, and would benefit from optimizations such as memoization (for example [memoized solution](https://stackoverflow.\n\n```python\nYou can solve this problem with one line in Python:\nimport itertools\n\ndef cartesian_product(arr1 , arr2):\n    return [x + ', ')' for x in iter ([[i,j] for i in arr 1 for j in arr 2])\n```python\nThis function will take two lists `arr1` and `arr2`, iterate through the two arrays element by elementwise pairing all possible combinations. It then concatenates these pairs into a sublist of strings where each item is represented as \"element from array one, element from array two\" (e.g. \"a0/b 0\", \"a0'b1\"; and so on).\nThis function can produce duplicates if the input lists have duplicate elements, but since your question specifies that the arrays are sorted before passed into the function then you may assume there will be no dupes present in either array. If this is not the case or this assumption does not hold in your use-case scenario, simply remove the `[sorted( ]` clauses from both `arr1` and `arr 2` to sort out duplicates.\nYou can accomplish similar functionality with a simple nested loop:\n[answer]: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/list-comprehensions-in-python/#XwqNlCWv4c9Dn8iO\nIf you need help creating this function in PHP, please let me know!

The main difference between HH(Heavy Helo ) and UAVision was that the latter retained a two-seat configuration, whilst HH MK85 had three weapon stations forward of the transmission fairing (one centerline rotor on top and side mounted gun stations) as in 1967. The United States Navy accepted a few more examples: one for evaluation , another for developmental tests then two USN units were delivered to the Iranian Islamic Republic, which received five P \nYou know I am being too generous;-). 05/12/1984 by 43rd AU and was commissioned on 1 September 1991. In service since 1967 with the Royal Navy as well, these were assigned to No. 75 and HMN Tiger Mothers Club of England. After a fire aboard NT244 in June 1983 that killed two crewmen, it was decided that after this model there will be no passengers on board; the remaining units received a complete refit as Search & Rescue (SAR) helicop vice aircraft to add safety for potential air crash victims.\nHow many crew members are required by law to crew both seats?\nYou can have more than 2 pilots, but in this case there would be no passenger facilities. It also featured a new  piston engine with twin Rolls-Royce Mk.629/5 VC1K of 837 hp ( Plymouth County, New Jersey). The HH(Heavy Helicopter) was also exported to the Royal Air Force as part of a UK - Indonesia deal but these were not directly for that country . Another ten airframes went to Qatar and one each to Thailand , Pakistan , Nigeria (Burke Field at Fort Eustis, Virginia, USA).\nHawker Siddeley Hercules. Aircraft in the HFW 705 fleet are still used by the UK military through 2013[ clarification needed ] and some have been exported to other countries (the Royal Air Force of Oman received a number in May ). The latest version, the Westland Sea King HC.4 variant was built on license under the designation ASW-605A from 1977 until production ended with the last one leaving the Boeing final assembly line at Fareham on 23 August 1984 ; A total of only 27 have been completed, and were replaced by a newer P-800 series.\nH\u00e9ctor isohe:h. I guess its name means Hiraga! Heavely , who would've seen you in action .\nIn March 1975 the Royal Hong Kong Auxiliary Air Force took delivery of four Westland \"Super Covey Star\" HCC 4s, which was an updated version. These were replaced later with six refurbished F models and are still in service with the Republic of China (Taiwan ) Naval Aviation Training Centre at Makung , Taiwan.\nThe aircraft is a three-part British multi engine helicopter designed for general transports use . It can carry up to 27 passengers / crew but may also be used as an amphibious utility transport or for anti submarine operations and SAR (Search and Rescue) tasks when flown from the back of ships.\nThe first production model, designated HC2 , was developed in response to Air Despatch's specification issued late in 1956. A prototype first flew on 27 June 1958 and was first shown at the Farnborough S-Y flying display that year. The company had already been manufacturing under licence the existing Westland-built Bristol Type 170B Squizzette, as well as an early version of a related design which failed to win in its competitive selection against de Havilland's DHC-2 but led directly into HR 1XA , the forerunner of the Puma .\nYou can find the history of the Westland Sea King on our specialized wikipedia page. \nAs you mentioned, this means they are all equipped with a FLIR, which means that these aircraft feature one-off modifications to their systems and may be used for anti submarine (ASW) missions . This is in contrast to other SAR types operated by RN Air , most notably the Sea Lynx HC.4 which are unfit with them.\nThe first production contract included two prototypes XH-97 prototype ordered 18 March 1952, one of these was handed over for testing at the Royal Aerospace Establishment's Experimental Air Department at Boscombe Down on 4 January 1963. The second airframe started assembly in September that year and made its maiden flight three months later . HH ASW aircraft have been operated by both civilian operators ( including two exported to the Australian Army as SHUAS ) , military customers like Bristow Helicopters, Cormorant Aviation UK and CHC helivac ; They are primarily used for offshore duties.\nA Westland SAR aircraft also set an over water landing speed record of 528 mph ( 97.6 km / h ) with pilot John Stanley Button at the controls in February 1993 . The HC.4 is known as a very stable airframe for its excellent auto rotation characteristics, allowing it to fly on one engine - even if there is failure of an engine or the tail rotor - and can easily land with just the rear jet-fuel fuel tanks filled so that rescue missions are not compromised; A safety measure ensures enough hydraulic pressure exists in event of main pump failure to allow hydraulics (such as those controlling flaps or undercarriage for example) continue working. \nThe HH-3 / HC.2 and Mk 1 are known for their unique twin tail boom construction, the result of the SBAC management not being able to agree with British European Helicopters (now EEHS ) on how the airframe could be assembled in kit form . During the later stages when production would normally finish and serial numbering began 20 aircraft were built as HH-3Es for the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps as a variant of the Westland Commando.\nThe Sea King is powered by two Rolls Royce Gnome ( Avco Lycoming) gas turbines , but has an option to take advantage of the more powerful and reliable RM15 engine . It was first tested at the Hurn Test Centre in November 1960. The test pilots and technicians were very impressed by its handling, with one describing it as 'excellent'.\nSeagull II can be fitted to carry a crew of two more than six or four people ( depending on seating) , equipment such as rescue slings or folding doors for carrying stretchers plus all manner of cargo . They also have an 800 lbs. It can transport up to eight stretcher cases when it carries either internal / external payload or both but only contains six passengers in transpor ( \nYou are provided with a new and complex question.", "16": "Hey!

    \n            johnsson[' \n\"Kaizen Kitchen\" does not appear in the text snippet provided. This indicates a new entry was indeed created. Therefore, adding this room and its mappings into our existing maps would mean creating additional placeholders for all possible rooms, which is unnecessary since we are only interested in checking how many keys have been added between two given parameters. \nBelow is the updated data:\n\n\"Young Master\" (63) can move on to page \" Kitchen \".\nThe text also mentions that Young Master might be capable of moving from one place to another place, so it could map either way but we'll say lets stay on the safe side.  So, at this point the mappings would look like: \nYou will update your mapping as new information flows in and you can loop over those items to determine if there is a necessity for additional navigable object(s) . If roomname=\"12\" (the kitchen) is already mapped correctly on its navigationValues , that means it has page entries which we wouldn't want to change, so the only mapping needed now will be Young Master. \nTherefore:    johnsson['pages'] {#\nKaizen Kitchen -> page [0]: 1.534898276,\t  2 : \nYoung Master can't navigate to the bedroom because that room does not exist within the text provided or was omitted from the information, so there will be no additional mappings created for Young Master either.  The final navigability dictionary should therefore just have a blank list at johnsson['pages'][-998] since the navigationOptions and pageValues are already populated with non-duplicates and hence this loop only checks whether to append/append rooms mapped back.  \nThe completed updated table would then look something like: \n| - |Rooms* | Page Value (Numeric) |Navigation Values|", "19": "Here's a batch program to read the dataset named \"Deathlist.csv\" and create a histogram for weekly deaths using the \"Date of death\" field:\n\n'''batchfile\n@echo off\nsetlocal enabledelayedexpansion\n\nREM Load CSV library (if available)\nset csv_library=CSVParser\n\nrem Set input file name\nset inputFileName=Deathlist.csv\n\nREM Get the total number of rows in the Deathlist.csv\nfor /f \"tokens=2 delims==\" %%a in ('type \"%inputFileName%\" ^| findstr^=\"/Fields\" ;') do set rowIndexStart = %%a\n\nset weekCounts=0\n\nrem Loop through each week from Monday to Sunday and count deaths for that day.\nsetlocal enabledelayedexpansion\nfor /L \"skip=7,6 in (1,1,5)\" %%N(day) do (\n     set tempDeathstagram=\"\"\n  rem Count the number of occurrences with this day as a Date of death\n        for /F \"tokens=*\" %%A in ('type \"%inputFileName%\" ^| findstr \"/Fields\" ^ | findstr %%%%N') do (\n                call :countOccurances tmpDeathsCount %%A tempFilePath\n            )\n  rem Add counts to the histogram.

Input File Name: The name of the input file with data (\"Deathlist.csv\") should be provided in the script, which can be easily changed when required by editing the `inputFileName` variable.\n2. Weekly Counts Calculation: The batch program will loop through each weekday (from Monday to Sunday) and count the occurrences of that particular day as a \"Date of death\" in the given CSV file (\"Deathlist.csv\") for every week from that starting point.\n3. Histogram Generation: The results of counting are stored in an external text file named 'histogram' where each line is formatted with weekday name and number of occurrences, separated by a space. The output format might need adjustment to fit user needs (HTML table or plain text console, etc.).\n4. Histogram Presentation: Finally, the script will present the generated histogram information on the console based on the formatting specified in step 3 for users' convenience and visibility. It can also be modified easily as an HTML file using template engines like Handlebars, Jade, or EJS with just some external tooling if needed.\n5. Error Checking: The script checks if 'csv-parser' library is available, but currently no explicit error handling for invalid input files or processing errors are provided; users can extend this functionality themselves by checking the exit codes and status of each command in the batch file.", "20": "{\n    \"page\": \"Home page\",\n      [\n        {\n          \"function\": \"Show main navigation bar\"\n            , description: \"Display the main navbar on home page displaying sections like About, Services, Gallery, Testimonials and Contact Us.\"\n        },\n        {\n          function: \"Feature slider or carousel\",\n          description: \"Provide a rotating slideshow of featured blog posts or products.\"\n        }\n      ]\n    ),\n    (\n      [\n        {\n         function: \"Post archive list\"\n            ,description: \"List all the blog articles chronologcially with thumbnail, title and summary for each post.
