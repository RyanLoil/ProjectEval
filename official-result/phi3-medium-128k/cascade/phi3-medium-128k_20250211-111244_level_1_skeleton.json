Let's break down the requirements into two distinct tasks: data processing and plotting, followed by constructing three histograms using seaborn based on groupings of grades (i.e., A, B, C) with separate lines and annotations for each). \n \nTo get started, let's start by loading the CSV file into a Pandas dataframe:\n\n```python\n# Import required libraries\nImport pandas  as pddf = pd.read_csv('/home/yourusername/mnt/folderPath /grades.csv') # Read csv files\n  \ndf['Grade'] = df[' Grade'].astype(float) \nTo calculate the average grade per student and create three DataFrames for each group: A, B, C based on their 'Name' column by using pandas filtering operation:\ngrades_A = df[df[' Name'] .apply (lambda x : 'A' in str(x))].reset_index(drop=True) \ngrades_B = df [df [' Name'].apply ( lambda x: \"name\" in str(x) and \"Name\" not in str( x)).reset_index( drop = True)]\ngrades_C = df[~np.isin(df[\"\\\\ n\", 'Name'], ['A', 'B'])].reset_index(drop=True)\n \nNow, we'll calculate the mean grade for each group and create a bar plot which shows this visually:\nsns.set(font = {\"height\":[9], \"fontsize\":14,\"family\":\" Arial\"}) sns.boxplot( data = grades_A['Grade'], orient='h' )\nplt.title('Average Grade by Age Group')  \n# This will plot a bar graph with x-axis as the group and y-axis as their respective average grade. The groups are based on age, so you may need to adjust this part according to your data structure.-Assistant\nHere's how our dataframe 'df' might look like:\nage_groups = df['\\\\ n'].unique() # list of unique age groups in the dataframe \n# Create a boxplot with Seaborn library \nfor group, group in [(\"Freshers\", grades_A), (\" Sophomore\", grades_B), (\"Juniors\",grades_C)]:  \n    sns.boxplot( data = group[['Grade']]) \n    plt.title('{} Grade Distribution by Age Group'.format (group))\nsns.show()", "11": "One of your tasks is to create a secure API for a password-protected website where users can register and login, as well as view their profiles and personal details once logged in.

Below is an example in Python that illustrates how to generate all possible combinations of elements from two sorted arrays by implementing the requirement through a recursive approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\ndef cartesian_product(arr1, arr2):\n    ## base case\n    if not any([arr 1, arr2]):\n        return [[]]\n    \n## Recursive step\n    result = []\n    if len (a) > 0:\n        for item in a[ : -1]:\n            for sub_combination in cartesian_product(arr1[1:], arr2):\n                yield [item]+[Subset]\n    \n# Usage\ncartesian_prod([X, Y, Z], [5, 6]) would give you the following result as output :\n[[x,'5'], ['x', '6'] , ['y','1'].....]\n'''python\nThis recursive function will return all combinations of elements from both arrays. You can test this code with a simple driver:\n**Solved! Here is the final solution to solve your problem:\ndata2 == [b(k) for k in b] and data3[j].replace('c', '1') == \n```python\nSure, here's how you can perform this task without using any built-in Python functions like range() or itertools.product():\npip install python -m pip install pylerp\nThen we will define a function called 'cartesian_product' that takes two arrays as its parameters and returns all the possible combinations from both sorted lists: \n\n```python\ndef cartesianProduct(arr1, arr2):\n    output = [[]]\n    \nfor i in range (0 ,len(arr1)):\n        for j in range (0 , len(arr2)) :\n            new_output=[i+[x + [arr1 [j]] for x in product (arr2, arr 2)]\n                output.append(*new_output)\n    return output\n'''\nWhen you call cartesianProduct([['a','b'], ['c', 'd']], [1, 2]) it would provide the following result:\n[[\"a\", \"1\"], [\" a \",\" c\"] , [\"b\", \"c\"] , [\" d\",\"1\"] , [\"a\", \"2\"] , [\" b\" ,\"c\"] , [\"a\", \"a\"] , [\"b\", \"d\"] , [\"b\", \"5\"] , [\"c\", \"d\"] , [\"x\", \"f\"],\nHere is the explanation in detail:", "15": "Q : How many days did it take to build the Wright Brothers' first plane, and what day is considered as its birthday?\nA: The history of this topic was marked by a series of major breakthroughs made in France around 80 years ago--the invention of two-cycle radial engines for aircraft that replaced pistons with the most powerful (e. This version had four seats and seating arrangements designed to accommodate stretcher stretchers, it featured an increased maximum gross weight than its predecessors at .

Here is an answer related to your inquiry:\n\nYou are provided with some tools and materials, including a computer simulator and virtual reality technology. You're trying to develop software that can efficiently calculate the optimal fuel consumption rates of ships based on various speed and load scenarios for both hull-mounted (HTAS / SSQ) and wing-borne engines . Your program will take input in the form of three tuples: a tuple containing engine RPM (\"Revolutions Per Minute\"), time in minutes between two values is considered as its birthday. HHHH 4 was introduced to the Royal Navy at Boscombe Down on January 26,1963 , with the first production aircraft entering service April the following year . For this exercise you have three sets of data:\n(i) Engine RPM in revolutions per minute (RPM, an integer),\n(ii ) The load carried by the ship (\"Load\") and a tuple containing speed in knots (\"Speed\") and calculate how much fuel (in liters per hour ) is used based on those parameters. Considering the following factors for your calculation: 1) Weight distribution: If more weight is added to the front or rear of the ship, it will result increase fuel consumption, as the engine has to work harder to move a heavier load .\nBased on these inputs , you must write a Python function that calculates and outputs: The program should output a JSON object with the calculated optimal throttle settings (rpm) for each of the following scenarios: Light Shipping (constant cruising altitude at 10 knots), \nThe Wright Brothers' first powered flight took about two years to develop.
