The `static` template library helps link a static file with its corresponding URL which can be used within the HTML files. Note that each page corresponds to a separate HTML file, and you should place your styling in `/yourapp/css/styles.css`. \n\nAlso, for importing the JSON file there is no direct function provided by Django or template tag so it will need AJAX request using JQuery or similar methods onfront-end side or AJAX call with a view backend to handle such functionality. In addition, as this application grows in size and complexity, you might want to consider breaking down these HTML templates into individual files for each corresponding Python view function in your Django project's `views.py` file. Each HTML template typically resides under the directory \"templates\" of an app named \"yourapp\".\n\nDon't forget: you'll need URLs set up appropriately to map URL patterns on `/url/path-to-page`, otherwise, no matter how great your templates are, not much will happen when navigating in Django. \nThis example is a very basic way of doing things and doesn't take all potential use cases or security concerns into account but can be customized to fit any real world scenario you come up with.
