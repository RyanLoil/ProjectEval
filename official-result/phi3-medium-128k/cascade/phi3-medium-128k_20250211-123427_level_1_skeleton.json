And you will use pandas dataframe and pythonic way with only those three lines of code:\n\ndef filter_data (orders, orders):\n  # Use a function or method to extract Year-Month from date ordered\" column into 'date' column in new columns ['Year', 'Month'] Then apply filtering on the filtered data. If possible provide some details of year and month for better analysis. Provide this information as two separate variables \"years_monthly\" and \"months\".\n \nFor your task, you can consider something like:\n```mysql   \n# First parse your json object to a pandas DataFrame  \ndf = pd . read_json ( orders) \n# convert 'date_ordered' column into datetime type  \ndf[' date']=pd.to_datetime(df [' OrderDate']) \n\nNow that we have the dates in a suitable format let's extract year/month information: \nSelect ['Year', 'month'] from df using to_period function which is used for grouping by both Year and Month then unstack(), groupby() on \"year\" and \"month\" columns, calculate sum of values for each pair (year/month). For our query, you can use the below piece.\n```sql\n# Filter only those items that have the exact category `\"Meals and Hospitality\"` \nnew_df = df[df[\"category\"] == 'Ordered Meals And Hospitality'] \n\nAfter this step, proceeding with:\n- You will need to perform a join operation between orders table and product using \"OrderItem_Icode\". It is necessary for you to know the primary key relations here.\n\n```sql\n# Perform inner join on OrderId and ItemID after ensuring they match in both tables \nmerged_df = pd.merge (new_df, products, on='Product Code', how='inner')\n\nFinally, group this merged dataframe by 'Year' and 'month', getting the SUM of `Cost` for each group. At last, your output will be a pandas DataFrame with columns ['OrderId, 'ItemID', 'Cost',' ]. Remember that you don't need to write any SQL query since it is not specified in the original prompt but you could just show an example using some dummy values within the Python code assuming we have the correct tables and relationships.\nYou will have a new DataFrame with columns 'OrderId, 'ItemID', 'Costs','Year, 'Month'. Remember this: your provided pythonic SQL query isn't asked here to be used as is in the response. Instead you are expected to design an optimized database join query using pandas only and return it as plain text.\nYou can do so by generating the final script including appropriate comments explaining every main operation. \nThis task can require intermediate knowledge about Python, SQL-like operations, Pandas framework and basic data manipulations.\nAssuming the following schema is given:\norders (OrderItem_Icode : int, OrderId : integer, ProductCode : varchar(50), QuantityOrdered : float , PaymentType  : string )\\\\n''',\n    \"  \n-- Your response needs to include a dataframe and SQL-like operations.
