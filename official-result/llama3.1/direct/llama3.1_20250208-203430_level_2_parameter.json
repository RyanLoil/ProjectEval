I used its path as the answer for 'entry' in the 'CheckFileExistence' function and also in the 'RunProject1' function. For other functions, I have used the corresponding file's path mentioned below.\n\nAlso, please note that you would need to adjust these answers according to your actual project setup and requirements.\n\nIn the case of 'script/batch_program.sh', since it contains a shebang line (`#!/bin/bash`), I assume this script is supposed to be run from the command line as an executable file. Therefore, its full path is used in the answer for 'entry'.\n\nSimilarly, since the main project does not rely on any external data files such as CSVs which are not explicitly imported within code, the existence of these files might seem unnecessary for testing, but I kept them to cover various possible scenarios.\n\nFor the \"ValidateHeaders\" function, considering that it is intended to validate if all required columns are present in a particular file like `Deathlist.csv`, its path was provided."}
